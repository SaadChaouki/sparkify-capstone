# Sparkify Capstone Project

## Description
This project is the final project of the Udacity Data Science nanodegree. The projects deals with the data of a fictional music streaming called Sparkify. A dataset was provided that contains the actions of users on the website in terms of pages visited, songs, time, and whether the users have downgraded (churn). 

The goal of the project is to train a model that can predict whether a user is likely to churn using PySpark to handle the large amount of data as well as an app using Flask and Plotly to visualise the change of data overtime.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisite

* PySpark
* Flask
* Plotly
* Pandas
* Numpy

### Files

* **run.py**: Flask app with data visualisation.
* **sparkify.ipynb**: Exploration code to load, create features, and train different models to predict churn.


### Cloning

To run the code, clone this GIT repository:

`git clone https://github.com/SaadChaouki/disaster-response-project.git`

### Executing

1. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.
    `python run.py`

2. Go to http://127.0.0.1:5000

### Web Application

Screenshots of the application are included [here]().
